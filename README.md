# 🔐 Secure IAM Architecture with Keycloak & Flask

This project implements a secure Identity and Access Management (IAM) architecture using **Keycloak** as the identity provider and a **Flask** application as a protected microservice. It secures RESTful endpoints via OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling only authenticated and authorized users to access protected resources.
